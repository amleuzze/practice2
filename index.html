          Audre Lorde discusses her fears and experiences as a Black lesbian raising a son. She identifies a teaching that she seeks to instill in her son, that she does not exist to do his feeling for him. Lorde writes, “Men who are afraid to feel must keep women around to do their feeling for them while dismissing us for the same supposedly “inferior” capacity to feel deeply” (Lorde 74). There is a painfully obvious juxtaposition between the way society receives men expressing emotion versus women expressing emotion. Men are taught to be tough, stoic, and strong. Showing emotion is a sign of weakness and a vulnerability to be avoided at all costs. Women, on the other hand, are expected to be emotional. It is seen as natural, yet women’s “emotional tendencies” are used to justify unequal treatment and sexism. For example, people have repeatedly said that women cannot be important political figures because they would menstruate and start a war in a second because of their mood swings. Certain emotions are socially acceptable to express as a man. Anger is one of these, and is typically expected to be expressed through the raising of voices and aggression. An angry man is intimidating and justified in his anger, yet oftentimes when anger is expressed by a woman, she is seen as “crazy” or “neurotic”.

          Feminism has long been incorrectly defined as a movement for the progression of women’s rights and women’s rights alone. For me personally, feminism is about men, women, and anyone that lies elsewhere on the gender spectrum. It is about taking away gendered expectations and eliminating these toxic stereotypes about who is allowed to say what, who is allowed to feel what, and who is deserving of respect based on whether they fit into one particular gendered box. Men should be allowed to be vulnerable and express deep, sometimes uncomfortable emotions without their masculinity being questioned. And women should be able to express emotion without being invalidated with accusations of being “too sensitive” or “crazy” because of their gender. Emotional validation is essential to feeling comfortable communicating one’s needs and wants. I saw a poster recently from the book “When We Fight, We Win!” by Rinku Sen that reads, “For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there is a boy tired of appearing strong when he feels vulnerable… For every girl who is tired of being called over-sensitive, there is a boy who fears to be gentle, to weep”. This is an issue with multiple sides and multiple perspectives. For every criticism of a woman or girl expressing emotion, there is an opposite criticism of men/boys. Because of the double faceted nature of this issue, it is important that we discuss toxic masculinity as a detriment to the lives of people of all genders.
